# ðŸ§  ML-Architectures

**ML-Architectures** is a structured knowledge project designed to deeply explain how classic machine learning models work â€” from their internal mathematical structures, loss functions, optimization processes, to complete training pipelines.

This project helps you understand:
- What exactly a model like Linear Regression, SVM, or XGBoost is doing internally
- How gradient-based optimization adjusts parameters
- How to build, train, and evaluate models from scratch
- The core intuition behind loss functions and optimizers
